# SCENARIO 3 - Packet Transmission

## Question 1.

A node transmits a 128-byte packet over a 64 kbps channel and the propagation delay is 10 ms. 

To synchronize the sending between the sender and the receiver, the flow control method "stop and wait" is used with an ACK of one bit and a wait time of 40 ms.


## Question 2.

A packet switched network sends 1 KB packets and the link between two nodes has a capacity of 4 Mbps.

The packets arrive at the nodes according to a Poisson distribution and the service time follows an exponential distribution.
